    Do I need to spin up an aws image for this to work or can I acheive this internally only with SMTP?

        Output?

    If running the docker image returns the wanted output in the shell, then the task can be deemed successful? or should running the image be successful
    and the output should be the output, doesn't matter if it's error or successful.

upon request, insert into queue.
Upon fail, insert into queue

Should have dedicated logs and metrics endpoint? what type of auth for that? 


the /enqueue endpoint will enqueue the task using RPUSH
the workers will running already in separate goroutines, upon enqueue, they will take out the task when available using BLPOP. check how many retries,
run the retries that many times. They will be in an infinite for loop, so that they keep checking the list. and since BLPOP is a blocking function, they won't move
forward unless that shi available in list
